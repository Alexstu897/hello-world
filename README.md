Trying to educate myself.

Here’s a short summary of a fun day at AstroWorld in 1998, as seen from the eyes of a computer scientist:

It was a sunny day in Houston, Texas, and I decided to visit AstroWorld, a popular amusement park located between Kirby Drive and Fannin Street. I was excited to try out the latest rides and attractions, and I wasn’t disappointed.

I started my day with a ride on the Texas Cyclone, a wooden roller coaster that was modeled after the famous Coney Island Cyclone. The ride was thrilling and fast, and I felt my heart racing as we went up and down the steep hills.

Next, I tried out the Thunder River, which was considered the world’s first successful river rapids ride when it opened in 1980. The ride was a lot of fun, and I got soaked as we went through the rapids and waterfalls.

After that, I decided to take a break and grab some food. I enjoyed a delicious corn dog and some cotton candy while watching other visitors enjoy the park.

Finally, I ended my day with a ride on the Batman: The Escape, a steel roller coaster that was designed to simulate the experience of being launched from a cannon. The ride was intense and exhilarating, and I felt like I was flying through the air.

Overall, it was a fantastic day at AstroWorld, and I can’t wait to go back and try out some of the other rides and attractions
